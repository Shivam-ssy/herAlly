  Our project title is herAlly, this project basically deals with the providing a common platform where women can report the victimization they faced or currently facing. Our platform list out the genuine and rated NGOs that works on this domain.
Today main problem is any women canâ€™t feel safe to reveal their identity while reporting incidents they face or facing.
Some NGOs try to maintain privacy to some extent but they fail because of many reasons some of them are..
Inadequate Anonymity in Reporting, Unintended Information Leakage, Insecure Communication Channels, Poor Access Control, Tracking of Physical Visits or Interventions etc.
Due to all this again a women may feel unsafe to reports the incidents.
Our platform act as a mediator that is hiding personal details of victim until he manually choose to reveal it to NGOs .
Our platform also ensure No additional information of user goes to Ngos until user give it manually.
Victim communicate with NGOs anonymously , seeks kinds of help like online counselling and legal help.
Due to this platform women can reports their incidents without any fear of indentity reveal.<br>
