        <p className="px-5">
          Our Mission is to unite NGOs and empowering women victims to seek
          justice, support and protect their identity by keeping their identity
          anonymous. This will solve the issue of hesitation due in women, due
          to society stigma, privacy concerns and fear of retaliation
        </p>
        <h3 className="font-bold mt-10 text-3xl">Our Vision</h3>
        <p className="px-5">
          Our vision is to build a place where women free from violence and
          fear, they can report crime without the fear of society stigma leading
          to more crime report which help to reduce crime in society.
